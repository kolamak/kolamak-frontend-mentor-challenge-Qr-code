# Project Overview

This project is a simple QR Code Component built using HTML and Tailwind CSS.
It displays a clean, centered card on the homepage containing a QR code image, a headline, and a short description.

The goal of this project is to practice layout design, component styling, and centering elements using Tailwind’s utility classes. It demonstrates how to build a responsive and visually appealing card layout, similar to the Frontend Mentor QR Code Component challenge.

# Github Repo- [https://github.com/kolamak/kolamak-frontend-mentor-challenge-Qr-code.git]

# Features -

- Responsive, centered layout using Tailwind’s flex utilities
- Clean and modern design with rounded corners and shadows
- Lightweight structure (pure HTML + Tailwind CSS)

# Built with - [HTML5,Tailwind CSS]

# What i learned -

Through this project, I learned how to:

- Use Tailwind CSS utility classes to style and position elements efficiently.
- Center a div both vertically and horizontally using Flexbox (items-center, justify-center, min-h-screen).
- Apply responsive width and spacing utilities in Tailwind for cleaner layouts.
- Work with Tailwind’s color and typography system to create a simple, modern design.
- Structure a basic HTML component layout and manage hierarchy (container → image → text).

# Continued development-

Moving forward, I plan to:

- Improve my understanding of responsive design and make layouts adapt better to different screen sizes.
- Explore more Tailwind CSS features, such as grids, custom themes, and animations.
- Practice building more UI components to strengthen my front-end design skills.
- Work on project structure and reusability, preparing for larger, real-world web projects.

# Acknowledgments-

This project means more to me than just a coding exercise, it represents another step in my journey of growth, discipline, and creativity as a developer.

Special thanks to Frontend Mentor for creating real-world challenges that continue to shape how I learn, build, and think about design. I’ve learned to take simple ideas and turn them into something that reflects effort and improvement.
